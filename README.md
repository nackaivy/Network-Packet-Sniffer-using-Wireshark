# Network-Packet-Sniffer-using-Wireshark
Wireshark is a widely used network protocol analyzer that enables users to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time. It provides a graphical interface for inspecting the data packets that traverse a network, making it an invaluable tool for network administrators, security professionals, and developers.
Key Features of Wireshark

Packet Capture: Wireshark captures packets from a network interface, allowing users to see the raw data being transmitted over the network. This includes all types of traffic, such as HTTP, TCP, UDP, and more.
Protocol Analysis: Wireshark can decode and display the details of various network protocols. It provides insights into the structure of packets, including headers and payloads, which helps in understanding how different protocols operate.
Real-Time Monitoring: Users can monitor network traffic in real-time, which is useful for troubleshooting network issues, analyzing performance, and detecting anomalies or security threats.
Filtering and Searching: Wireshark offers powerful filtering capabilities, allowing users to focus on specific packets of interest. Filters can be applied based on various criteria, such as IP addresses, protocols, or port numbers, making it easier to analyze large volumes of data.
Statistics and Reporting: The tool provides various statistical analyses, such as protocol hierarchy, conversation statistics, and endpoint analysis. These features help users understand traffic patterns and identify potential issues.
Cross-Platform Support: Wireshark is available on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
Use Cases

Network Troubleshooting: Network administrators can use Wireshark to diagnose connectivity issues, identify bottlenecks, and analyze packet loss or latency problems.
Security Analysis: Security professionals can monitor network traffic for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or malware communication.
Protocol Development: Developers can use Wireshark to test and debug custom protocols by analyzing the packets sent and received during communication.
Educational Purposes: Wireshark is often used in academic settings to teach students about networking concepts and protocols, providing a hands-on experience with real network data.
Conclusion

Wireshark is a powerful and versatile tool for network analysis, offering deep insights into network traffic and protocol behavior. Its ability to capture, analyze, and visualize data makes it an essential resource for anyone involved in network management, security, or development. However, users should always be mindful of ethical considerations and legal regulations regarding network traffic monitoring.
